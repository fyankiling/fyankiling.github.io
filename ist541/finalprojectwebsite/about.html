<p>The ADDIE Model was developed and adopted by the military to speed up and standardize production of training materials, often by persons having less than a thorough background in instructional design (Reiser and Dempsey, 2018). The five steps of the ADDIE Model was used in the military for its clear presentation of steps that are given in five phases: <i><b>Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement and Evaluate</b></i>. Today, the ADDIE Model is used by training developers and instructional designers for blueprint and creating effective learning experience. When utilizing the ADDIE Model when creating projects for eLearning, or other projects, the five steps are completed in consecutive steps.
